# kh-ng2-playground
Angular2 playground project for getting in touch. Used Angular2, TypeScript, SystemJS and Gulp Task Runner.

## Getting Started
Clone project via git or download sources as zip.

Use `npm install` to install dependencies and typings.

Run lite server with `gulp run` on default port 8000 or `gulp run --port portnumber` with portnumber replaced with the actual number if your port 8000 already is in use.
